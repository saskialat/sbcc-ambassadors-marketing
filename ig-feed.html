          <b> Events post </b>:
          If there is something from the events committee to post (such as the ), post that. But if there aren't any, it's the marketing team's responsibility to make content that showcases our events. Consult with events, what event can we start posting? Or, post a previous event. 
          <br>
          Not to confuse you with the Throwback Thursday posts (see below), for this events slot, we can edit a picture from our previous events and write a small description of it. For this, ask help from ambassador members that have stayed before Spring such as the interns (Nikhil and Rebecca), or ask Shelby.

        <p>
          <b> Throwback Thursday </b>:
          Post any picture from this folder, unedited. Or you can put on filters, but no need to write down anything with this pictures. The goal is to show the Ambassadors as organic as we can to make us seem more approachable.

        <h5> Friday </h5>
        <p>
            <b> An Ambassador </b>:
            Each Ambassadors can be asked to write a paragraph about themselves, talking about a story in their life/ background. 
            It can be how they usually eat at their home countries/ an experience/ the challenges they face studying in the US. This way, we can become "ambassadors" for our own country to the SBCC Community & people who follow our page. 
            We can try to inspire others with our own stories!
            <br>
            <div class="example">
                <i>Example:</i>
                <br>
                <center> <img src="img/friday-example.png" alt="Sample picture" width="40%"> </center>
                <br>
                <i>this is the caption, which is what the ambassador is saying, the caption is the paragraph longer than the quote in the picture. Pretend this is what I'm saying. Throughout my life, I have moved schools 10 times. Some of the schools I went to were International schools and some of them were public schools. This made me realize how privilege plays a huge role in determining one's life. Blablablbalbalabla. Blablablabalababalalalbabalablaaablallba </i>

        <h5> Saturday </h5>
        <p> Free day </p>
       
        <h5> Sunday </h5>
        <p>
            <b> Community Development Post </b>:
            Sunday is a good day, because you get to do it the whole week! It's also helpful to post before Monday, so people can have access to this resource in the beginning of the week.
            However, the right timing for a Community Development Post depends on the time the information is obtained because this has to be posted as recent as possible to fulfill its point of informing other people.
