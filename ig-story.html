      <h3> Instagram Story Guide </h3>
      <p> 
        Few tips for instagram story:
        <br>
        <br>
        1. <b><i>Try as best as you can to post more than one story everyday.</i></b><br>
        Reason: We have to stay relevant. People need to know that SBCC Ambassadors is active. 
        A lot of people also skip around when viewing instagram stories, so it's easy for them to just skip us without even noticing that we posted.
        The best way to grab their attentions is by posting a lot.
        <br>
        2. <b><i>When another SBCC account tags us, repost their posts.</i></b><br>
        If they tag us a share of their posts, open the post and share their post (also mention the @ so they will know we posted it) instead 
        of reposting the igstory tag. This way, people can directly click on the post if it's relevant. 
        It is important to repost what other accounts tag us to build a good relationship with them, so everytime we tag them, they will do the same.
        <br>
        4. <b><i>Post our feed posts on the Story, better: Create the same post, Instagram Story Version</i></b></br>
        Not all posts from all accounts are showed in an account's feed, so everything should go to the story to ensure that everyone will have a chance of seeing the story. This is also a way to add content to our story.
        <br>
        4. <b><i>Decorate, personalize.</i></b><br>
        When posting on Instagram Story, try as best as you can to decorate the Instagram Story. Don't worry too much about going out of our brand, a little bit
        of inconsistency (to a certain extent) is good to give an impression that we the Ambassadors is a group of real humans, rather than an unapproachable organization.example
        Decorating the reposts and our posts as weell. Add a couple of comments, (e.g. "check this out")

      <h3> Instagram Story Ideas </h3>
      <p> 
        I listed things to post each day in the next Section (Daily Instagram Story Schedule), but that is only a few instagram story posts each day, that is not enough. 
        For the Instagram story, we should think out of the box and try to post different things every week.
        <br>
        <h5> Small projects </h5>
        <p> 
          Ideas that will only require one edit, can be done anytime:

          - One essential thing for the online Semester (As for Aug 28 2020, it is on going, but should be posted on the instagram within a week)
          <br>
          - Favorite food from their homecountries
          <br>
          - One essential thing for the winter

          <i> How to start a big project? 
            <br> 
            1. Assign someone to take the lead.
            <br> 
            2. The person assigned should ask in the Whats App group for people to volunteer, set a deadline (Heads up: There won't be that many people volunteering, so ask the interns to help you to scout people/ dm others)
            <br>
            3. When the videos start coming in, edit them. If you can't edit them, it's okay, simply post it on instagram story, but don't forget to decorate.
